00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.750
One of the most important factors to keep
in mind while creating a web page is,

2
00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.130
file sizes.

3
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:07.910
The more data you have to load,

4
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.300
the more your site visitors will have to
wait around.

5
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.820
This is always important, but

6
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.390
it's especially important with media, like
audio and

7
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.670
video because, they typically have much
larger file sizes than text and images.

8
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.040
It's not enough to just take a video clip
from your camera or

9
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.760
your smart phone and just toss it onto a
web page.

10
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.730
Rather you need to make sure that you've
compressed the video and audio properly,

11
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.790
so that it has a small file size, but
still looks and sounds good.

12
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.190
So, there's a couple of different programs
that you could use to do this.

13
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.580
One is VLC, or VideoLAN and this is a
media player,

14
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.520
but it does a whole bunch of stuff and one
of them is convert video.

15
00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.210
You could also use another program like
Adobe media encoder or

16
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.410
maybe a non linear video editor of your
choice.

17
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.520
Just about anything will be able to
convert the video into at

18
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.500
least H.264 which is a format supported by
Internet Explorer and Safari.

19
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.930
However to get the files into ogg theora,
VLC should work just fine.

20
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.520
So let's switch over to VLC.

21
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.040
You can download it and when you install
it on a Mac,

22
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.740
it will look something like this.

23
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:36.530
And I'll go up to file here, and I'll say
convert slash stream and it will give me

24
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:43.000
a window here were I can open media and
then I have a file here I want to convert.

25
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.390
So, I already have this video and this was
shot on a pretty nice camera but

26
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.790
you can get this same kind of file format
from an iPhone or,

27
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.150
maybe an android phone and convert it.

28
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.290
Pretty much any incoming video, you can
convert into the format that you need.

29
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.530
Next, you'll need to choose a profile and
there's two things going on here.

30
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.160
There is the encapsulation, and there's
also the video o-deck.

31
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.270
So before we get into that, let's go back
and take a look.

32
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.250
The encapsulation is basically the file
format.

33
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.940
So, in this case we're gonna have an MP4
but we could have something like WebM,

34
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.610
which is another web based video format.

35
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.430
And there's also Theora Vorbis or Ogg
Theora, as it's sometimes called.

36
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.550
And this is going to be an Ogg file
format.

37
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.600
So that's the encapsulation.

38
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.320
Then the Kodak is how the video and the
audio, is actually compressed.

39
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.208
That's why there's two things listed on
each one of this with a plus.

40
00:02:47.208 --> 00:02:52.640
So, each .264 in this case is the video
compression, and

41
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.950
then mp3 is the audio compression.

42
00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:03.140
There's also theora vorbis, which is a
video and audio combination.

43
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.290
So, again, for Internet Explorer and
Safari, this first one will work and

44
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.260
then you can click save as file, and

45
00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.320
then you can choose an output location, so
maybe you can save it in the same spot and

46
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.300
just call it my video, or whatever you
want to call it.

47
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.830
In this case, we called it Bridge.mp4, and

48
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:30.550
you would click save and it would start to
convert for you.

49
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:36.140
And then you would want to do the same
thing for Theora Vorbis, and

50
00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:42.060
if you click browse, you could save it to
a location, and it will save out.

51
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.740
Now, the thing to remember here is you
want to keep the file size low so,

52
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:52.720
if you click that customize button, you
can go to the video codec and

53
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.680
let's actually go back to h.264 plus mp3,
and

54
00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.590
under video codec here, you can adjust the
bit rate so

55
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.110
you might want to put something on the
order of 5000 or maybe 10,000.

56
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.560
And slowly work your way down.

57
00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.590
And the frame rate for this particular
video is 24 frames per second, but

58
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.420
you can adjust that if you'd like.

59
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.500
And then you'd want an output resolution.

60
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.770
This is another place that you can play,
with the file size.

61
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.220
So, you might say 1280 by 720.

62
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.080
And the source for this particular video's
1920 1080, so we'd actually be scaling

63
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.500
this down in resolution a little bit, but
that will produce a smaller file size.

64
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.800
So the bit rate and the resolution under
video.

65
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.430
Are two things to pay attention to.

66
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.720
So when you output video and audio, make
sure to adjust your settings

67
00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.980
appropriately, so that you get the optimal
balance between file size and quality
